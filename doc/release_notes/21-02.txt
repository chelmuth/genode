    os: introduce new "Uplink" session
    
    Adds new Uplink session interface, the corresponding client side (Client,
    Connection), and the corresponding API archives. An Uplink session is almost
    the same as a NIC session with the difference that the roles of the end points
    are swapped. An Uplink client is the one that provides a network interface
    (for instance, a NIC driver) whereas an Uplink server is the one that uses
    that network interface (for instance, a networking stack).
    
    Therefore, in contrast to the NIC session, MAC address and link state come from
    the Uplink client. The link state is reflected through the lifetime of an
    Uplink session: The client requests the session only when the link state is
    "UP" and closes it whenever the link state becomes "DOWN" again. The MAC
    address is transmitted from the Uplink client to the Uplink server as an
    argument of the session request.

    nic_router: act as "Uplink" server
    
    Let the NIC router provide an Uplink service besides the Nic service that it
    already provided. Requests for an Uplink session towards the NIC router are
    assigned to Domains using the same <policy> configuration tags that are used in
    order to assign Nic session requests. The MAC addresses of Uplink session
    components are _NOT_ considered during the allocation of MAC addresses for NIC
    session components at the same Domain. The task of avoiding MAC address clashes
    between Uplink session components and Nic session components is therefore left
    to the integrator. Apart from that, Uplink session components are treated by
    the NIC router like any other interface.

    nic drivers: provide optional Uplink-client mode
    
    In order to perform a smooth transition from NIC drivers that act only as NIC
    session clients to NIC drivers that act only as Uplink session clients, this
    commit introduces an intermediate state in which all NIC drivers support both
    modes. That said, a NIC drivers mode is now statically determined through a new
    optional 'mode' attribute in the drivers <config> tag that can be set to either
    'nic_server' (default value) or 'uplink_client'. Reconfiguring this attribute
    at a driver doesn't have any effects. Whithout this attribute being set, all
    NIC drivers will behave the same as they did before the commit. When set to
    'uplink_client', however, instead of providing a Nic service, they request
    an Uplink session whenever their network interface becomes "UP" and close the
    session whenever their network interface becomes "DOWN".

    glib: adaptions for libmbim
    
    1. glib: don't assume GNU libiconv
    
       This removes the glib config switch that made the build assume a GNU libiconv
       which led to the following compile error:
    
       ! .../lib/glib/glib/gconvert.c:55:2: error: #error GNU libiconv in use but
       !   included iconv.h not from libiconv
    
    2. glib: fix "no such instruction" in symbol file
    
       This changes several 'R' entries to 'T' entries in the glib symbols file that
       caused assemble errors as follows:
    
       ! glib.symbols.s:1621: Error: no such instruction: `glib_binary_age R'
       ! glib.symbols.s:1625: Error: no such instruction: `glib_interface_age R'
       ! glib.symbols.s:1626: Error: no such instruction: `glib_major_version R'
       ! glib.symbols.s:1628: Error: no such instruction: `glib_micro_version R'
       ! glib.symbols.s:1629: Error: no such instruction: `glib_minor_version R'
    
    3, glib: adapt run script
    
       - Remove obsolete pthread.lib.so boot module as it is now part of
        libc.lib.so.
    
       - Provide '/tmp' directory as a g_file_open_tmp test wants to create
         a file in there.
    
       - Use [depot_user] for selecting depot archives instead of hardcoding
         it to 'genodelabs'.
    
    4. glib: enable gobject and gio subsystem
    
       - Provide proper definitions for 32 and 64-bit machines
       - Add gobject and gio subsystems
       - Depends on libffi, which is currently only availabe for arm_v7a and
        x86_64.
    
       The 'glib' symbols file contains pretty much all symbols, even if the
       belong to supported or rather not supported backends, e.g. dbus.

    nic_router: support multiple DHCP option 6 entries
    
    * The NIC router now considers, memorizes, and, if configured, reports
      multiple DHCP option 6 entries from DHCP replies that it received as DHCP
      client
    * A DHCP server at the NIC router can now be configured statically with
      multiple DNS server addresses to propagate
    * The 'dns_server_from' attribute of the DHCP server of the NIC router now
      supports the forwarding of multiple DNS server addresses
    * The automated run/nic_router_dhcp test tests all the above mentioned new
      functionality and reconfiguring it at runtime. The test was added to the
      autopilot.
    * All run scripts were adapted to fit the new NIC router configuration
      interface

    * Introduce 'use_arp' configuration flag at the NIC router in order to disable
      requesting IP-to-MAC address resolutions via ARP for domains.
    * Add automated run/nic_router_disable_arp test to the autopilot that tests
      the effect of the new flag

    vfs/pipe: add fifo feature to pipe plugin
    
    The vfs pipe plugin can now be used as named pipe which anables data
    transfer via file handles from one component to another. E.g. if one
    would like to send data from component A to stdin of a libc component B,
    one can do so by simply writing to that fifo file.

    vfs/pipe: refactor read/write synchronization
    
    All pipe-ends were notified at the same time which leads to dead-locks.
    This commit mitigates this by having a signal handler for each pipe and
    each pipe-end respectively.
    
    Issue #3583

; contribution by Sid:

The vfs/pipe plugin now has a named pipe feature. The main motivation was to
easily stream data from pure Genode components to libc components via
file-system sessions that can be attached to stdin, stdout, and stderr. This
feature further makes it possible to pipe several components together,
similarly to how it is done on Unix. Additionally, the thread synchronization
has been improved so that large data chunks can be transferred without
blocking.

    qemu-usb: use bounce buffer to access DMA memory
    
    The former implemention assumed that the guest physical memory is
    mapped continously. This, however, is not true. Writing larger
    files to an USB stick with a Windows 10 guest would therefore lead
    to data corruption.
    
    The current implementation uses a bounce buffer to copy the data
    to and from the guest physical memory and leaves dealing with the
    memory mappings entirely up to the VMM.

    Linux as well as Windows guests want queue to a varying number of

    than queuing multiple iso frames per requests (like is done with OUT
    transfers).
    
    The number of requests queued is increased to 32 while the number of
    packets per reques is decreased to 1.

    usb_host: properly handle ISOC read requests
    
    * Update the 'packet_size' information with the actual length for
      each isoc frame to be able to handle short reads at the client side.
    
    * Copy the whole transfer buffer because the host controller stores
      the data at the original offsets, i.e., the buffer is not densely
      packed.
    
    Fixes #4018.

    - update to privileged ISA v1.10 (from v1.9.1)
    - use direct system calls for privileged core threads (they call into
      the kernel and don't use mode changing system calls, i.e. 'ecall',

    Avoid use of REP_DIR in *.mk files to simplify the use of these files as
    templates for a board hosted in a separate repository.
    
    Use REP_INC_DIR for searching headers, thereby considering headers
    hosted in an external repository.

    This patch allows for supplementing the existing run-tool plugins with

    base-hw: introduce board-property directories
    
    This patch moves the bootstrap-link-address information from the
    tool/run/boot_dir/hw file to board-specific property files that can be
    accessed by using the board as key. This eliminates the need to
    customize boot_dir/hw when hosting board-support in an external
    repository.
    
    Fixes #3998

    base-hw: streamline extraction of depot archives
    
    This patch simplifies the packaging of the base-hw kernel for a given
    board, in particular when the board support is hosted as an external
    repository such as genode-world. Regardless of where the board-support
    is hosted, the content.mk file becomes as simple as:
    
      include $(GENODE_DIR)/repos/base-hw/recipes/src/base-hw_content.inc
    
    The board name is automatically inferred from the path of the src
    recipe. The architecture is determined from board/<name>/arch files,
    following the pattern of the image_link_address. The attempt to build a
    base-hw-<board> binary archive for the wrong architecture is now
    gracefully handled by skipping all targets (using the REQUIRES
    mechanism).
    
    Besides the improved convenience, the patch results in depot archives
    that are much closer tailored to the actual board by omitting files for
    architectures that are not used by the board. E.g., the src/base-hw-pc
    archive does not contain any ARM-related content.
    
    The patch also restores the package builds for core/bootstrap object
    files as a follow-up fix of "base: remove SPEC variables of boards",
    which happened to left 'BOARD' undefined in the src archives.
    
    Fixes #4019

    Add ccache support to build system
    
    This patch simplifies the use of ccache with the build system. Up until
    now, each developer had to set up the ccache hooks manually, adjust the
    PATH variable, and customize the etc/tools.conf in each build directory.
    With the patch, ccache can be enabled by un-commenting a single line in
    the etc/build.conf file.
    
    Fixes #4004
